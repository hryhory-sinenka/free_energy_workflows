This is a protocol for running equilibrium RBFE calculations.

R1 contains the pre-generated data needed to run RBFE calculations.

The 03-alchemical-bound folder corresponds to the transformation in the protein-ligand-water system. There, please use HOWTO.sh script to run the protocol and ANAL.sh to analyse it. 

The 05-alchemical-unbound folder corresponds to the transformation in the ligand-water system. There, please use HOWTO.sh script to run the protocol and ANAL.sh to analyse it.
